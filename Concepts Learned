SQL Concepts Learned:
1. RDBMS - RDBMS is a software system which is used to store only data which need to be stored in the form of tables. 
		   In this kind of system, data is managed and stored in rows and columns which is known as tuples and attributes. 
		   RDBMS is a powerful data management system and is widely used across the world.
2. Query Processor  - It receives an instruction or instructions written in Structured Query Language (SQL), 
					  chooses a plan for executing the instructions and carries out the plan
3. DataBase Engine -  A database engine (or storage engine) is the underlying software component 
				      that a database management system (DBMS) uses to create, read, update and delete (CRUD) data from a database.			
4. Parser and Optimizer - The task of the SQL parser in a database server is to parse the SQL statements submitted from client applications 
						  and to determine a way to retrieve or store data according to these statements. 
						  A rule-based optimizer determines the most effective way to execute an 
						  SQL statement by applying a set of preprogrammed rules.
